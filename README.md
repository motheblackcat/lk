Unity 2D heroic-fantasy adventure game demo.

My first attempt at making a 2D game demo with the Unity engine, my goal is to acheive a small but satisfying action oriented first level before expanding toward a more complexe metroidvania game style.

Feel free to contribute in any way you wish!

You can test the current build here: https://motheblackcat.github.io

Upcoming Features / Improvements:

- Secondary weapon system remake
- Advanced Start Menu
- Options menu

Known Bugs / Things to check:

- Jump animation from anystate prevent attack animation from being fully played during a jump
- Attack sound played with no animation when spamming (check if attack is registered)
- Warning on animation param "watch"
- Check audio logic for enemies "Destroy (gameObject, source.clip.length)"
- Check global audio logic (is the implementation of an audio manager worthwhile?)
